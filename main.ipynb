Medical imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provide detailed \n    views of brain tissue, enabling doctors to identify abnormalities. However, manual inspection of MRI scans \n    can be <strong>time-consuming, prone to human error, and limited by specialist availability</strong>.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    In recent years, <em>deep learning</em> and <em>computer vision</em> have emerged as powerful allies to \n    healthcare professionals. By training models to automatically recognize patterns in MRI images, we can \n    create systems that assist radiologists in making faster and more consistent assessments, potentially \n    saving lives.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">üéØ Our Goal</h3>\n  <p>\n    The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of \n    <strong>classifying brain MRI scans into ‚Äútumor‚Äù or ‚Äúno tumor‚Äù categories</strong>. This will involve \n    carefully preparing the dataset, applying state-of-the-art image processing techniques, and leveraging \n    transfer learning for improved accuracy on our relatively small dataset.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">üõ† Our Approach</h3>\n  <p>\n    We will progress through a structured pipeline: understanding the dataset, preprocessing and augmenting \n    images, designing and training a neural network, evaluating its performance with multiple metrics, and \n    finally, packaging the solution for deployment via an accessible API. Each step is designed with \n    <strong>real-world usability and medical ethics in mind</strong>.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">üåç Impact</h3>\n  <p>\n    While this model alone won‚Äôt replace medical experts, it can serve as a valuable <em>decision-support tool</em>. \n    Hospitals with fewer resources could benefit from automated screening, and radiologists could use it \n    to double-check scans and reduce the risk of oversight. \n    Ultimately, our work aims to demonstrate how AI can complement ‚Äî not replace ‚Äî human expertise in a \n    mission as vital as saving lives.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#013220; color:#f0f0f0; padding:20px; border-radius:10px; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; line-height:1.6;\">\n  <h2 style=\"color:#90EE90; text-align:center;\">üß† Brain MRI Tumor Detection ‚Äì Project Roadmap</h2>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Exploration</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Load MRI images from <code>yes/</code> and <code>no/</code> folders.</li>\n    <li>Inspect image counts per class.</li>\n    <li>Visualize a few positive & negative samples.</li>\n    <li>Check image resolution & quality.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Resize images to standard size (e.g., 224x224).</li>\n    <li>Normalize pixel values to 0‚Äì1 range.</li>\n    <li>Apply data augmentation (rotate, zoom, flip).</li>\n    <li>Split into train/validation/test sets.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">3Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Use Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet).</li>\n    <li>Fine-tune layers for MRI-specific features.</li>\n    <li>Use binary classification (sigmoid activation).</li>\n    <li>Incorporate dropout & regularization to avoid overfitting.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.</li>\n    <li>Plot confusion matrix.</li>\n    <li>Check ROC curve & AUC score.</li>\n    <li>Prioritize sensitivity (recall) for tumor detection.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3 style=\"color:#ADFF2F;\">5Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment (maybe)</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Save trained model (<code>.h5</code> or <code>.pth</code>).</li>\n    <li>Build inference API with FastAPI.</li>\n    <li>Optionally add web UI for image upload & prediction.</li>\n    <li>Document usage & limitations clearly.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
